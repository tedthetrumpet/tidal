The samples are all from these instruments:

This is the pelog half of Glasgow’s ‘Spirit of Hope’ set of instruments, used by [Naga Mas](https://www.example.com), the Glasgow Gamelan Group. ‘Pelog’ is the name of the tuning. Our instruments are *approximately* D, Eb, F, G#, A, Bb, C – some notes are sharper or flatter than they would be in equal temperament A=440. This is not standardised: two different ‘pelog’ gamelans will have a roughly similar set of seven notes, but there may be significant differences of detail in the exact pitches.

The names of the individual banks are (mostly) the names of the instruments: peking, saron, demung, slenthem, kendhang, kenong and gong.

The set called 'barung' is confusing: maybe I shouldn’t have called it that! The instrument is called ‘bonang’. There are two in the ensemble an octave apart: the 'bonang panerus' and 'bonang barung' respectively. This is the lower octave set, so I just called it 'barung'.

fada has it’s own readme.

*Pelog* is better described as a ‘tuning’ rather than a ‘scale’: traditional Javanese music does not really use ‘scales’ in the same way that western music does. This is quite a deep topic, and a good example of western (colonialist?) assumptions distorting an indigenous musical practice.

The tuned banks all have sample:0 that is duplicated. This is a deliberate hack! One way that gamelan musicians name notes is using the numbers 1-7 from low to high. The lucky fact that samples are loaded into SuperDirt/WebDirt in sorted order means that, by putting an extra sample at 0, the following will play the correct pitches as a Javanese musician would name them:

`n "6 5 3 2" # s "demung"`
