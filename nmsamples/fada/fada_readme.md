# About these samples

These are recordings of the Scottish Gaelic song 'Chuir iad mise dh'eilean leam fhìn', sung solo by Gamelan Naga Mas member Murieann Levis.

The context: in 1999 group member Mags Smith composed a piece called 'Waves' as part of an extended original work by the group, 'Sedna, the Woman Under the Sea', that incorporated this melody. In 2020, the group returned to this composition, reconfiguring in a performance that combined livecoding using MiniTidal in Estuary with live vocals in Zoom.

Muireann recorded the song for us: the 32 bars were then split into 8 two-bars sections for convenience in coding. There was a slight miscommunication, however! To match the gamelan it should have been sung in Gm, but Muireann based her performance on the recording on the 'Bairn's Kist' CD by Christine Stewart, which is in Bm. http://www.christinastewart.com/index.asp?pageid=172364 Fortunately, we found we were able to work with the song in that key, despite the fact that it clashes almost completely with the notes of our pelog gamelan.

The lyrics are as follows:

Chuir iad mise dh'eilean leam fhìn\
Chuir iad mise dh'eilean leam fhìn\
Chuir iad mise dh'eilean leam fhìn\
Dh'eilean mara fada bho thìr\

Fada, fada, fada, bho thìr\
Fada, fada, fada, bho thìr\
Fada, fada, fada, bho thìr\
Dh'eilean mara fada bho thìr\

Rough translation: 'They left me here on this island alone, on this island far away'
